As part of the <strong>National Entrepreneurship Challenge (NEC)</strong> by IIT Bombay, I explored strategic thinking and entrepreneurship by contributing to business model development and community engagement. I believe in consistent growth, creative thinking, and staying resilient—guided by my personal motto: <b><em>“Rest if you must, but don’t you quit.”</em></b>
